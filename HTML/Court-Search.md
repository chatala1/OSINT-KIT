# Welcome to [@cyb_detective](https://twitter.com/cyb_detective) Collection of Sites for Searching Court Rulings and Cases

Searching through court documents is one of OSINT's most underrated methods. When searching a person's name in Russian court cases, I have had occasion to find the names of their places of work, home address, names of relatives, car VIN, interesting biographical facts, and more. Public court documents are rich in confidential information to varying degrees in different countries. And by no means always can you find as much interesting information there as you can in CIS court documents. But even the area of a person's residence registration and the article under which he was prosecuted can help a lot in further collection of information about him.

## Warning!
This list is no longer being updated. More court search services for different countries can be found at: [Worldwide OSINT Tools Map](https://cipher387.github.io/osintmap/)

Here's a list of 62 sites to search for court documents in various countries. I plan to add new services there regularly.
